# Gmail Mover: Product Vision

## Executive Summary

Gmail Mover is evolving from a simple email transfer tool into a comprehensive 360-degree personal information management platform. The core philosophy centers on **augmentation over replacement**, **user data ownership**, and **transparent AI** - creating a system that enhances existing workflows rather than forcing users to abandon familiar tools.

## Core Philosophy

### Augment, Don't Replace
- Enhance Gmail and other services without forcing workflow changes
- Layer intelligence on top of existing tools users already trust
- Provide opt-in adoption levels from basic tracking to full archival

### User Data Ownership
- SQLite databases owned and controlled by users
- Complete data portability between deployment models
- No vendor lock-in - users can always export their intelligence and rules

### Transparent AI
- Human-readable rules generated by AI that users can review and modify
- Explainable decision-making rather than black-box automation
- User maintains control over classification logic and can understand why decisions were made

## Product Evolution Roadmap

### Phase 1: Email Intelligence Platform
**Current Focus: Gmail Enhancement**

#### Hybrid AI + Rules System
**The Problem**: Traditional email management forces users to choose between inbox chaos and missing critical messages due to rigid filtering rules.

**The Solution**: 
- **Learning Phase**: AI analyzes email corpus, generates human-readable rules based on patterns and user feedback
- **Operational Phase**: Rules handle 90% of emails automatically (fast, transparent, debuggable), AI processes edge cases
- **Continuous Learning**: System updates rules based on new patterns and user corrections

#### Smart Classification Categories
- **Time-sensitive**: Deadlines, meetings, urgent responses with auto-reminders
- **Offers**: Sales, promotions, deals with expiration tracking and relevance scoring
- **Notifications**: System alerts, receipts, confirmations with auto-expiration
- **Mailing lists**: Newsletters, updates with digest views and unsubscribe suggestions  
- **Personal**: Friends, family (always visible priority)
- **Business**: Work-related with context-sensitive priority based on current projects

#### Advanced Email Intelligence Features
- **Interest Decay**: "Things that might interest you" lists with configurable timeout (30+ days)
- **Context-Sensitive Priority**: Email priority adjusts based on active projects (e.g., Digital Ocean emails prioritized during active DO projects)
- **Burst Detection**: Multiple messages from same sender triggers classification review
- **Smart Deals Management**: Track by vendor, topic, expiration with "show occasionally" options
- **Periodic Summaries**: Digest emails of medium-priority items with archive options
- **Soft Delete**: Remove emails from lists without actually deleting, letting time-based rules handle eventual filing

### Phase 2: Multi-Platform Expansion

5. **Browser Data**: Tabs, bookmarks, browsing history with intelligent categorization
6. **Financial Data**: Purchase history, payment tracking, transaction categorization

#### Cross-Platform Intelligence
- **Unified Contact Graph**: Build relationship networks across all communication platforms
- **Context Correlation**: Understand when email about a project relates to Slack discussions or shared documents

## Long-Term Vision

Gmail Mover represents the foundation for a new category of personal information management - one where users maintain complete control over their data while benefiting from collective intelligence. The platform's success will be measured not just by user acquisition, but by the creation of a sustainable, user-controlled alternative to the current landscape of data-siloed, vendor-locked personal productivity tools.

The ultimate goal is enabling individuals to have comprehensive, searchable, intelligent access to their entire digital life while maintaining complete ownership and control over that information.
