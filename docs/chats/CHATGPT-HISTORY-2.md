# CHAT HISTORY #2 ‚Äî SQLite binary field support

does sqlite support binary fields?  Are the reliable?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, SQLite fully supports binary fields via its BLOB (Binary Large OBject) data type, and they are reliable when used properly.

‚úÖ Binary Field Support in SQLite
SQLite has five storage classes:

NULL

INTEGER

REAL

TEXT

BLOB ‚Äî used to store binary data exactly as it is.

You can define a column with any of the following:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE files (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT,
data BLOB
);
Or even:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE mytable (
binary_data BLOB NOT NULL
);
SQLite stores the data in BLOB fields verbatim, i.e., without character encoding, escaping, or compression unless you explicitly apply any of those manually in your app code.

‚úÖ Reliability of BLOBs in SQLite
SQLite BLOBs are reliable under the following conditions:

1. Use parameterized queries
   Always bind BLOBs using parameters rather than trying to encode them into SQL strings. Examples:

In Go:
go
Copy
Edit
stmt, err := db.Prepare("INSERT INTO files(name, data) VALUES(?, ?)")
if err != nil {
// handle error
}
_, err = stmt.Exec("image.png", binaryData)
This avoids issues with escaping or corruption.

2. Be careful with read/write size
   SQLite can handle BLOBs up to the maximum page size, which by default is 1MB but can be increased up to 2GB. The actual max size is governed by:

sql
Copy
Edit
PRAGMA max_page_count;
PRAGMA page_size;
PRAGMA max_blob_size;
You can increase limits if needed:

sql
Copy
Edit
PRAGMA max_blob_size = 104857600; -- 100 MB
Or via the C API using sqlite3_limit().

3. Streaming BLOB I/O (optional)
   For very large BLOBs, SQLite supports incremental I/O using:

sqlite3_blob_open()

sqlite3_blob_read() / sqlite3_blob_write()

This is available in C APIs, not directly in higher-level bindings. You likely won‚Äôt need it unless you‚Äôre storing GB-sized binary content.

4. ACID compliance
   SQLite‚Äôs ACID-compliant design ensures BLOBs are atomically stored along with other data. There's no risk of partial writes (unless you're misusing transactions).

‚ùóCaveats
Concern	Status / Guidance
Text encoding issues	Not a concern. BLOBs are raw bytes.
Compression	SQLite does not compress BLOBs. Use manual compression (e.g., gzip) if needed.
Searchability / Indexing	BLOBs cannot be indexed or searched meaningfully.
Corruption on copying DB file	Use sqlite3_backup API or VACUUM INTO to ensure correct handling of BLOBs and WAL mode if copying DB.
Memory usage	Avoid loading huge BLOBs entirely into memory if you can stream instead.

üß™ Example Use Cases
Store images, PDFs, or serialized objects.

Store compressed JSON or protobuf binary records.

Keep signatures or audio snippets.

üîí Encryption Consideration
SQLite does not encrypt BLOBs by default. If you're storing sensitive binary data:

Encrypt the BLOB contents before storing.

Use SQLCipher (a full-database encryption extension for SQLite).

Summary
Feature	Supported
Binary data	‚úÖ BLOB type
Reliable storage	‚úÖ ACID-safe
Parameterized use	‚úÖ Required
Large BLOBs	‚úÖ With config
Streaming I/O	‚úÖ Via C API
Indexing/search	‚ùå Not supported
Compression	‚ùå Manual only

Let me know if you need a Go or Python example, or want help with large binary storage patterns.







You said:
I am asking because I want to create a SQL archive for email and I am wondering it would be viable to store a compressed version of the original message. The code for this will be written in Go.


ChatGPT said:
Yes, storing a compressed version of the original email message in a SQLite BLOB column is entirely viable, and for your use case‚Äîan email archive written in Go‚Äîthis is both reliable and efficient if done right.

Here‚Äôs a full breakdown tailored to your project:

‚úÖ Why This Approach Is Viable
SQLite is stable and fast for moderate-scale archival

Ideal for single-user or local archive use.

Can easily handle tens of millions of rows if indexed and vacuumed properly.

Storing compressed email messages in a BLOB is safe

Compressed data (e.g., using gzip) is just a stream of bytes ‚Äî perfect fit for a BLOB.

You can always decompress later for full-text search, export, etc.

Efficient storage

Emails (especially HTML-heavy ones) compress very well.

You may reduce storage by 70‚Äì95%, depending on the message content.

Go has great support for compression and SQLite

Use compress/gzip or compress/zstd.

Use github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 (or modernc.org/sqlite if CGO-free).

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Strategy
1. Schema Example
   sql
   Copy
   Edit
   CREATE TABLE email_archive (
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
   message_id TEXT UNIQUE,
   subject TEXT,
   from_addr TEXT,
   to_addr TEXT,
   date TEXT,
   compressed_raw BLOB NOT NULL
   );
   Store metadata separately for indexing/search.

compressed_raw holds the full original .eml (or rfc822) body compressed.

2. Go Code Example
   Insert
   go
   Copy
   Edit
   import (
   "bytes"
   "compress/gzip"
   "database/sql"
   _ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
   )

func compress(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {
var buf bytes.Buffer
gz := gzip.NewWriter(&buf)
_, err := gz.Write(data)
if err != nil {
return nil, err
}
err = gz.Close()
return buf.Bytes(), err
}

func insertEmail(db *sql.DB, meta EmailMeta, raw []byte) error {
compressed, err := compress(raw)
if err != nil {
return err
}

    _, err = db.Exec(`
        INSERT INTO email_archive (message_id, subject, from_addr, to_addr, date, compressed_raw)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
    `,
        meta.MessageID,
        meta.Subject,
        meta.From,
        meta.To,
        meta.Date,
        compressed,
    )
    return err
}
Decompress and Read
go
Copy
Edit
func decompress(data []byte) ([]byte, error) {
gz, err := gzip.NewReader(bytes.NewReader(data))
if err != nil {
return nil, err
}
defer gz.Close()
return io.ReadAll(gz)
}
üß† Tips & Considerations
Compression Format
gzip is widely supported and simple.

zstd has better compression ratios and speed, especially on large payloads.

Indexing
Index on metadata fields (message_id, from_addr, date) ‚Äî not the BLOB.

Consider a secondary FTS5 table if you later want to full-text search.

Search
You can extract + decompress + index content lazily for FTS later if needed.

Alternatively, keep both: compressed raw + extracted text in a separate column.

Backup and Resilience
Use VACUUM INTO or sqlite3_backup() for safe, consistent backups.

Row size limit
SQLite has a default max row size of 1GB, configurable up to 2GB.

Most emails will never get close to that even uncompressed.

üîê Optional: Encrypting Emails
If you want to add encryption (e.g., for PII or sensitive content):

go
Copy
Edit
// Pseudocode
encrypted := Encrypt(Compress(emailBytes))
storeToBlob(encrypted)
But keep in mind:

You‚Äôll lose ability to deduplicate or search compressed text.

You‚Äôll need to store and rotate keys securely.

Summary
Feature	Supported / Best Practice
Store compressed email	‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî use BLOB + gzip or zstd
Use Go with SQLite	‚úÖ Use go-sqlite3 and compress/gzip packages
Searchable metadata	‚úÖ Keep subject, from, to, date, etc. in separate fields
Large message support	‚úÖ SQLite handles up to 2GB per row
Binary storage reliable	‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî ACID-safe, no encoding issues
Optional encryption	‚úÖ Use your own key scheme + AES or NaCl

Advice on full-text indexing decompressed email bodies.

Recommendations on archiving structure (e.g., folder ‚Üí table, tags, etc.).







You said:
I envision that we might store a version of the email that has been stripped of unimportant information like HTML formatting and prior email content if fully quoted from the email replied to and also would store headers that are relevant to the user separately from the compressed raw email. We could use FTS5 on that content.

Next, I am pondering how to query the GMail API to be able to archive email?  Should I simply query by date range, like after:2020/1/31 before:2020/3/1 to get all Feb 2020 emails, and then just look through all months until I have found all emails?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, your proposed approach for querying Gmail by date range, combined with iterating month by month (or week by week for fine control), is both effective and idiomatic when using the Gmail API.

Below is an exhaustive guide covering:

‚úÖ Part 1: Gmail Archival Strategy Overview
Your design:

‚úÖ Store raw compressed email (BLOB)

‚úÖ Extract metadata headers into structured columns

‚úÖ Extract body text (e.g., stripped of HTML and quoted content)

‚úÖ Use FTS5 on cleaned text for search

This is excellent for long-term archiving:

You retain the original message for compliance.

You make the important parts searchable.

You remove storage waste (quoted text, unnecessary markup).

‚úÖ Part 2: Querying Gmail API by Date Range
The Gmail API does not let you fetch all emails in a single request. You must page through messages, but you can filter using the same Gmail search syntax as the web UI:

go
Copy
Edit
q := "after:2020/01/31 before:2020/03/01"
Use this with:

http
Copy
Edit
GET https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages?q=after:2020/01/31 before:2020/03/01
This returns a list of matching message IDs.

‚úÖ Part 3: Full Archival Loop in Go
Here‚Äôs a high-level outline of how to pull all emails from Gmail:

1. Use users.messages.list to get IDs by date range
   go
   Copy
   Edit
   svc.Users.Messages.List("me").
   Q("after:2020/01/31 before:2020/03/01").
   PageToken(nextToken).
   Do()
   You‚Äôll receive:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"messages": [
{ "id": "abc123", "threadId": "xyz456" },
...
],
"nextPageToken": "..."
}
Loop until nextPageToken is empty.

2. Use users.messages.get to fetch full message
   go
   Copy
   Edit
   svc.Users.Messages.Get("me", messageID).
   Format("raw").Do()
   This returns:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"raw": "base64url-encoded-string=="
}
You must decode this with base64 URL-safe decoder:

go
Copy
Edit
decoded, err := base64.URLEncoding.DecodeString(resp.Raw)
Now you can parse it using net/mail:

go
Copy
Edit
msg, err := mail.ReadMessage(bytes.NewReader(decoded))
From here:

Strip the body using your own HTML cleaner / quote stripper

Store headers like From, To, Subject, Date, Message-ID, etc.

Compress and store decoded as your canonical copy

üõ† Tips for Implementation
Pagination Loop
For each time slice (e.g., month):

Call list with query string.

Loop over messages.

Fetch each message via get.

Sleep if needed (API has quota limits).

Proceed to next time slice when nextPageToken == "".

üîÑ Iterating Through Time Slices
You can safely iterate monthly using this logic:

go
Copy
Edit
// Pseudocode
for year in 2005..current_year:
for month in 1..12:
after = fmt.Sprintf("%d/%d/01", year, month)
before = firstOfNextMonth(after)
query = fmt.Sprintf("after:%s before:%s", after, before)
fetchMessages(query)
Or implement as a cursor (after:2020/01/31) and step by last message date.

This has the benefit of:

Easier rate-limit retries

Reduces likelihood of overloading Gmail with massive single queries

‚è≥ Gmail API Quotas
Resource	Limit (per user/day)
users.messages.list	~1,000,000 requests
users.messages.get	~250,000 requests
per-second rate	250 QPS

Use exponential backoff if RateLimitExceeded.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats
Gmail labels ‚â† folders
You may want to archive:

Only INBOX

Only SENT

Or exclude SPAM, TRASH, etc.

Filter like:

go
Copy
Edit
Q("label:inbox after:2020/1/1 before:2020/2/1")
You can combine labelIds in the .List() call too.

Use of raw vs full
raw gives base64-encoded .eml blob

full or metadata gives structured view (headers only)

Your use-case should use raw (canonical source)

üß™ Optional Enhancements
Add de-duplication using message_id field (stored in headers).

Use Go routines + semaphores to parallelize downloading message bodies.

Include a checkpointing mechanism to avoid re-fetching already archived messages.

Store Gmail threadId and labelIds for context.

Summary
Step	Approach
Discover messages	Use users.messages.list + after/before
Fetch content	Use users.messages.get with format=raw
Decode message	Use base64.URLEncoding.DecodeString()
Parse message	Use net/mail.ReadMessage()
Store original	Compress and store as BLOB
Store stripped version	Cleaned + indexed via FTS5
Iterate over time	Monthly range queries

You said:
Here is a message Id I see in the "Original Message" screen of the Gmail web UI:

20241230091844.94c88a2e5595b2e1@mailgun.example.org


Is this what email Ids look like, or are there multiple candidate Ids that I might need to consider?


ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî and yes, there are multiple "IDs" associated with an email message depending on context, and you should be aware of them all to build a robust email archiver.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the different types of IDs you‚Äôll encounter when working with Gmail and email messages in general:

üì© 1. Message-ID (RFC 5322 header)
The example you gave:

css
Copy
Edit
20241230091844.94c88a2e5595b2e1@mailgun.example.org
This is the standard Message-ID header, defined in RFC 5322 ¬ß3.6.4.

Characteristics:
Set by the sender (e.g., Mailgun or the sending MTA).

Must be globally unique (though some MTAs fail to enforce this).

Typically looks like: <random-string@domain>.

It‚Äôs enclosed in angle brackets in the header:

text
Copy
Edit
Message-ID: <20241230091844.94c88a2e5595b2e1@mailgun.example.org>
You can access it by parsing headers via net/mail:

go
Copy
Edit
msg.Header.Get("Message-ID")
Use this for de-duplication across mailboxes, because it‚Äôs preserved when an email is copied or forwarded (unlike Gmail's internal ID).

Note: Some emails lack this header, especially spam or poorly constructed messages.

üì• 2. Gmail Internal Message ID
This is the opaque string returned by the Gmail API:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"id": "180e3bba65d428a3",
"threadId": "180e3bba65d428a2"
}
Set by Gmail, not visible in the message content.

Only useful for querying Gmail via API.

Not stable across Gmail accounts: if the same email is sent to two Gmail accounts, the id will be different.

Use it for:

Fetching a message (users.messages.get)

Associating related messages in the same thread (threadId)

üßµ 3. Thread-ID (Gmail-specific)
This is the Gmail identifier for the conversation thread. Gmail groups messages into threads using heuristics based on Subject, In-Reply-To, and References headers.

You‚Äôll get it from the API along with message ID:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"id": "...",
"threadId": "..."
}
You may want to archive this to later reconstruct threads.

üìå 4. In-Reply-To / References (Threading headers)
In addition to Gmail‚Äôs internal threadId, real email clients use:

In-Reply-To: refers to the Message-ID of the parent message.

References: a chain of previous Message-IDs.

Example:

text
Copy
Edit
In-Reply-To: <abc@example.com>
References: <abc@example.com> <xyz@example.com>
Use these if you want to build your own threading logic (e.g., portable threading in your SQLite archive).

üì¶ Recommendation: What to Store
Purpose	Field to Use
Deduplication	‚úÖ Message-ID (RFC 5322)
Gmail-specific queries	‚úÖ id, threadId
Threading reconstruction	‚úÖ In-Reply-To, References
Original preservation	‚úÖ Compressed raw message

So in your SQLite schema, you might want:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE email_archive (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
gmail_id TEXT UNIQUE,           -- Gmail internal message ID
thread_id TEXT,                 -- Gmail thread ID
message_id TEXT,                -- RFC 5322 Message-ID
in_reply_to TEXT,
references TEXT,
subject TEXT,
from_addr TEXT,
to_addr TEXT,
date TEXT,
compressed_raw BLOB NOT NULL
);
You can extract all of these using net/mail and a bit of custom header parsing.

üß™ Gotchas
Not all emails have Message-ID, especially spam.

Some emails have malformed or duplicated Message-IDs.

Gmail id is not portable outside the Gmail API.

Headers like Message-ID may be case-insensitive but should be treated case-sensitive when comparing values.

Angle brackets (<>) in Message-ID should be stripped for storage/lookup, e.g.:

go
Copy
Edit
strings.Trim(msg.Header.Get("Message-ID"), "<>")
‚úÖ Summary
ID Type	Source	Globally Unique	Portable	Notes
Message-ID	Email header	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	Ideal for deduplication
Gmail id	Gmail API	‚ùå No	‚ùå No	Opaque internal ID
Gmail threadId	Gmail API	‚ùå No	‚ùå No	Gmail-only grouping
In-Reply-To	Email header	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	Thread relationship
References	Email header	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes	Thread chain

You said:
So for messages that do not have an ID should we has them to get an ID?

For the Gmail ID, would appending the account email make it globally unique, e.g. <GmailId>@<account_email>, but not to be mixed with Message-ID, of course?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, excellent questions ‚Äî and you‚Äôre thinking along exactly the right lines.

Let‚Äôs address both:

‚úÖ 1. Should You Generate a Message-ID for Messages That Lack One?
Yes ‚Äî if a message lacks a Message-ID, you should generate one yourself to:

Enable deduplication and threading.

Ensure every message in your archive has a stable identifier.

‚úÖ How to Generate One
You want something unique and reproducible, ideally derived from stable content, e.g.:

go
Copy
Edit
// Pseudocode
hash := sha256(rawMessageBytes)[:16]
messageID := fmt.Sprintf("%x@local.archive", hash)
This is:

Globally unique (assuming hash collision resistance)

Deterministic (given same message, same ID)

Clearly synthetic (using a domain like @local.archive)

üìå Important:
Never overwrite an existing valid Message-ID.

You can flag synthetic ones with a prefix or suffix, e.g., message_id_generated BOOLEAN.

‚úÖ 2. Can You Make Gmail‚Äôs Message ID Globally Unique by Appending the Account Email?
Yes, but with caveats.

‚úÖ You can do this:
text
Copy
Edit
<GmailId>@<user_email>
For example:

text
Copy
Edit
180e3bba65d428a3@gmailuser@example.com
This guarantees uniqueness across Gmail accounts.

‚úÖ Use-case:
This is helpful if you‚Äôre archiving from multiple accounts, and you want to:

Store Gmail's opaque ID in a globally unique form.

Easily reverse-map from storage to the original Gmail source.

‚ùå But do not treat this as a Message-ID:
Don‚Äôt confuse it with Message-ID from RFC 5322.

Don‚Äôt use it for threading or deduplication across accounts.

Instead, store it separately in a dedicated column:

sql
Copy
Edit
gmail_id TEXT,                    -- raw ID from Gmail API
gmail_global_id TEXT,            -- e.g. "<gmail_id>@user@example.com"
This way you retain:

Gmail‚Äôs internal ID for use with the Gmail API

A globally unique synthetic key for your own cross-account deduplication or internal indexing

‚úÖ Final Schema Guidance
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE email_archive (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
gmail_id TEXT,                      -- Gmail API ID
gmail_global_id TEXT UNIQUE,       -- gmail_id@user_email
message_id TEXT,                   -- RFC 5322 ID or generated
message_id_generated BOOLEAN,      -- true if synthetic
thread_id TEXT,
in_reply_to TEXT,
references TEXT,
from_addr TEXT,
to_addr TEXT,
date TEXT,
subject TEXT,
compressed_raw BLOB
);
üîÑ Optional: Use Both IDs Together
If you need a key for tracking messages that combines both Gmail and Message-ID for disambiguation:

go
Copy
Edit
uniqueKey := fmt.Sprintf("%s::%s", messageID, gmailGlobalID)
But usually:

Message-ID is sufficient for deduplication across mailboxes.

Gmail ID is for fetching.

A synthetic fallback Message-ID ensures completeness.

Summary
Situation	Recommendation
No Message-ID in message	‚úÖ Generate one using SHA256 of raw message
Make Gmail ID globally unique	‚úÖ Append user email like id@user@example.com
Use Gmail ID as a Message-ID	‚ùå Never ‚Äî keep separate
Identify synthetic message IDs	‚úÖ Add a flag or use a special domain suffix
Cross-account deduplication	‚úÖ Use Message-ID first, fallback to Gmail ID

You said:
Sqlite supports transactions, right?  I ask because I want to store email information in multiple tables.  For example, since this is an archive format space savings will be critical and this I would like to store all email addresses in an address table and then have an email_address table with email_id, address_id, and address_role  as an enum of To, From, CC, or BCC.


ChatGPT said:
Yes, SQLite fully supports transactions, and your use-case ‚Äî storing email data across multiple normalized tables for space efficiency ‚Äî is exactly the kind of use-case transactions were designed for.

‚úÖ SQLite Transactions at a Glance
SQLite provides full ACID compliance:

Atomicity: All statements in the transaction succeed or none do.

Consistency: Data remains in a consistent state.

Isolation: Other transactions don‚Äôt see partial updates.

Durability: Changes survive power loss once committed (depending on PRAGMA journal_mode).

In Go, using the database/sql interface:

go
Copy
Edit
tx, err := db.Begin()
if err != nil {
return err
}
defer func() {
if p := recover(); p != nil {
tx.Rollback()
panic(p)
} else if err != nil {
tx.Rollback()
} else {
err = tx.Commit()
}
}()
Then perform all tx.Exec or tx.Prepare calls using that tx handle.

üß± Schema Design: Normalizing Email Addresses
What you‚Äôre proposing is both correct and space-efficient, especially for archives that may contain:

Hundreds of thousands of redundant addresses

Messages with large CC/BCC lists

Here‚Äôs a design to match what you described:

üóÇ address Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE address (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
name TEXT             -- optional display name, nullable
);
Deduplicates addresses like john@example.com.

You might want to store name only if meaningful, since it often repeats uselessly.

üì¨ email_address Table
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE email_address (
email_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
address_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
address_role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (address_role IN ('From', 'To', 'CC', 'BCC')),
PRIMARY KEY (email_id, address_id, address_role),
FOREIGN KEY (email_id) REFERENCES email(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES address(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
Role is enforced using a CHECK constraint (no native ENUM in SQLite).

Composite primary key prevents duplicates (e.g., same address used multiple times in same role).

üì• email Table (Simplified for context)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE email (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
gmail_id TEXT,
message_id TEXT,
subject TEXT,
date TEXT,
compressed_raw BLOB
);
üß† Storage Considerations
If every email has ~5-15 address references, and you archive 1M messages, that‚Äôs 5‚Äì15M rows in email_address, but only a few thousand rows in address.

Even without indexes, SQLite is fast enough for archiving workloads. But:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_email_address_email ON email_address(email_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_address_address ON email_address(address_id);
üí° Inserting with Transactions (Go Example)
go
Copy
Edit
tx, err := db.Begin()
if err != nil {
return err
}
defer func() {
if err != nil {
tx.Rollback()
} else {
tx.Commit()
}
}()

// Insert email
res, err := tx.Exec("INSERT INTO email (...) VALUES (...)", ...)
emailID, _ := res.LastInsertId()

// For each address
for _, addr := range addresses {
// Insert or ignore if exists
_, err := tx.Exec("INSERT OR IGNORE INTO address(email, name) VALUES (?, ?)", addr.Email, addr.Name)

    // Lookup ID
    row := tx.QueryRow("SELECT id FROM address WHERE email = ?", addr.Email)
    var addrID int64
    err = row.Scan(&addrID)

    // Insert role mapping
    _, err = tx.Exec(
        "INSERT INTO email_address(email_id, address_id, address_role) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
        emailID, addrID, addr.Role)
}
You‚Äôll want to add prepared statements and reuse them if doing this at scale.

üîÑ Optional Enhancements
Use email.display_name table if you want to separate display names from address ‚Äî this avoids name being tied to the email itself, which can vary over time (From: "Mike" <you@example.com> vs From: "Michael" <you@example.com>).

Add a received_headers table if you want to store multi-hop delivery chains.

If you plan to filter by sender domain, store email_domain separately and extract using a BEFORE INSERT trigger or app logic.

Summary
Feature	Supported / Recommendation
SQLite transactions	‚úÖ Yes, fully ACID-compliant
Normalize addresses	‚úÖ Use address + email_address
Enforce roles (To/From/...)	‚úÖ Use CHECK() on column
Store compressed raw email	‚úÖ Use BLOB column
Multi-table insertion	‚úÖ Wrap in BEGIN / COMMIT

Would you like me to generate:

A complete Go function for inserting an email with normalized addresses?

FTS5 setup to search message content and address names/emails?

JSON schema for easier external export/import of this archive format?







You said:
If no enum, then I would use address_role IN ('F', 'T', 'C', 'B') to save space, and have a virtual field that display the name.

I also want to have all primary keys be int and then have constraints for those things that must be unique, like email_id, address_id, address_role. I could also see a name_id field in email_address backed by a name table so that Mike is just one record. As you implied, names should not associate with email address but instead associate with the email_address linking table that relates the address to the email.

Yes ‚Äî your instincts here are spot-on, and your evolving schema is well-suited to both space optimization and semantic accuracy, which is especially important in archival formats.

Let me walk you through the refined schema plan and associated rationale for each part, incorporating:

Compact role encoding ('F', 'T', 'C', 'B')

Use of INTEGER primary keys only

Name deduplication via a separate name table

All UNIQUE constraints separate from the PRIMARY KEY

Use of a virtual/computed column for readability

üß± Proposed Normalized Schema
email
Stores the actual email message.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE email (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
gmail_id TEXT,
message_id TEXT,              -- May be generated if missing
date TEXT,                    -- ISO8601
subject TEXT,
compressed_raw BLOB
);
address
Stores email addresses only.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE address (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
name
Stores display names used across emails.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE name (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
display TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
email_address
Junction table relating an email to an address (via address ID), its role, and optionally its display name for that specific context.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE email_address (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
email_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
address_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
name_id INTEGER, -- nullable if no display name
role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('F', 'T', 'C', 'B')),  -- From, To, CC, BCC

    -- Enforce uniqueness of tuple
    UNIQUE (email_id, address_id, role),

    FOREIGN KEY (email_id) REFERENCES email(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES address(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (name_id) REFERENCES name(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
Optional: Virtual Column for Display
If your SQLite version is ‚â• 3.31.0 (Jan 2020), you can define a computed/virtual column:

sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE email_address ADD COLUMN role_label TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
CASE role
WHEN 'F' THEN 'From'
WHEN 'T' THEN 'To'
WHEN 'C' THEN 'CC'
WHEN 'B' THEN 'BCC'
END
) VIRTUAL;
You can then SELECT role_label for human-friendly output without storage cost.

üß† Why This Design Is Effective
Design Element	Benefit
Integer-only PKs	Space-efficient; indexing optimized
Role as 'F', 'T', etc.	Compact; still semantically clear
Virtual label	No duplication; human-readable
Unique email_id + address_id + role	Prevents duplicates in same role
Separate name table	Shared display names don't repeat
name_id on email_address	Captures sender-specific naming ("Mike", "Michael") without tying it to address

üß™ In Practice (Go Pseudocode Summary)
Insert Flow
Start transaction.

Insert into email; capture email_id.

For each From, To, CC, BCC address:

Insert or get address_id.

If display name exists, insert or get name_id.

Insert into email_address with (email_id, address_id, role, name_id).

Commit transaction.

Optional Enhancements
Indexes:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_email_address_email_id ON email_address(email_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_address_address_id ON email_address(address_id);
Add tags table or email_tag table for keyword classification.

Store each header field in a header table if needed for full fidelity archival.

Summary of Core Tables
text
Copy
Edit
email          ‚Üí main email metadata + raw blob
address        ‚Üí deduplicated email addresses
name           ‚Üí deduplicated display names
email_address  ‚Üí links emails to addresses with role and optional display name
Table	Primary Key	Uniqueness Constraints
email	id (int)	message_id may be UNIQUE if enforced
address	id	email UNIQUE
name	id	display UNIQUE
email_address	id	email_id + address_id + role UNIQUE

Would you like:

Go struct definitions + insert code for this schema?

Sample SQL to list all To: addresses per email?

FTS5 schema to link to email.id for full-text search?

Let me know and I‚Äôll expand in that direction.

üì¶ SQLite-Based Email Archive Design (Gmail + Go)
This document outlines the architecture for a compressed, searchable email archive backed by SQLite and implemented in Go. It is designed to optimize for space, performance, and long-term maintainability.

üîß Goals
Efficient long-term storage of Gmail emails, including original message fidelity.

Deduplication of redundant email addresses and display names.

Full-text search over cleaned email content.

Accurate threading using standard headers and Gmail metadata.

Designed for use with Go and the Gmail API.

üìã Schema Overview
email
Stores canonical email metadata and compressed raw message.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE email (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
gmail_id TEXT,
message_id TEXT,               -- RFC 5322 or generated
date TEXT,                     -- ISO8601
subject TEXT,
compressed_raw BLOB
);
address
Stores unique email addresses.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE address (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
email TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
name
Stores unique display names used with addresses.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE name (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
display TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
email_address
Links an email to one or more addresses, by role and optionally a display name.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE email_address (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
email_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
address_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
name_id INTEGER, -- nullable

    role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('F', 'T', 'C', 'B')), -- From, To, CC, BCC

    UNIQUE (email_id, address_id, role),

    FOREIGN KEY (email_id) REFERENCES email(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (address_id) REFERENCES address(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (name_id) REFERENCES name(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
role_label (Optional virtual column for display)
sql
Copy
Edit
ALTER TABLE email_address ADD COLUMN role_label TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
CASE role
WHEN 'F' THEN 'From'
WHEN 'T' THEN 'To'
WHEN 'C' THEN 'CC'
WHEN 'B' THEN 'BCC'
END
) VIRTUAL;
‚úÖ Implementation Highlights
Transactional Inserts (Go)
Wrap inserts for email, address, name, and email_address in a transaction.

Use INSERT OR IGNORE for deduplicated address and name inserts.

Lookup id after insert and use it for the email_address join record.

Message-ID Handling
Use Message-ID from the RFC 5322 header when available.

If missing, generate one using a hash of the compressed raw message:

go
Copy
Edit
sha := sha256.Sum256(raw)
msgID := fmt.Sprintf("%x@local.archive", sha[:16])
Gmail ID Handling
Gmail message ID (gmail_id) is opaque and not portable.

Create a unique variant:

go
Copy
Edit
gmail_global_id := fmt.Sprintf("%s@%s", gmail_id, user_email)
Full-Text Search
Store a cleaned version of the email body (no HTML, no quoted prior content) separately.

Use FTS5 on that body to enable efficient search.

Do not apply FTS to the BLOB.

üß† Design Benefits
Design Element	Benefit
Normalized address and name	Reduces redundancy for high-volume fields
Compressed BLOB storage	Retains original fidelity with lower size
email_address table with role	Models correct semantic relationship
Enum-like role codes (F, ...)	Saves space with human readability
Virtual role label	Zero-storage human-friendly queries
Transactional writes	ACID-safe inserts across normalized tables

üõ†Ô∏è Optional Enhancements
Add indexes on:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_email_address_email_id ON email_address(email_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_address_address_id ON email_address(address_id);
Track threading using In-Reply-To and References headers.

Add email_tag or email_folder tables for classification.

Defer full-text indexing of cleaned body for scalability.

üß∞ Tooling Notes
Use net/mail.ReadMessage() to extract headers and body.

Use compress/gzip or compress/zstd to compress raw messages.

Use Gmail API users.messages.list with:

text
Copy
Edit
q="after:2020/01/01 before:2020/02/01"
and paginate across time.

Use users.messages.get with format=raw to retrieve .eml.

Let me know if you'd like this exported to a downloadable file, markdown, or used as the basis for Go struct definitions or FTS schema setup.
