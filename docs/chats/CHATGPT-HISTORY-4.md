# CHAT HISTORY #4 — UI add-ins for mail clients

You said:
Is it possible to create UI add-ins that could display dashboard type widgets in:

- Outlook desktop?
- Mac Mail?
- iOS Mail?
  -Android Mail?
- Gmail Web Browser?
  -Gmail Mobile App?


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a breakdown of whether you can create UI add-ins that display dashboard-type widgets for each of the listed email clients:

✅ Supported
Outlook Desktop (Windows & Mac)
✅ Yes, via Office Add-ins (Web Add-ins)

Microsoft supports JavaScript-based Office Add-ins, which work in:

Outlook Desktop (Windows & macOS)

Outlook on the Web (OWA)

Outlook Mobile (limited support)

You can create task pane add-ins that show dashboard widgets using HTML/CSS/JS.

Integration is declarative via a manifest XML file and JavaScript for runtime behavior.

Widgets can appear in a pane beside the email, and you can respond to selected messages.

🚫 Not Supported (No Public API/UI Extension Support)
Mac Mail (Apple Mail)
❌ No, not possible

Apple Mail has no public plugin API for modern macOS versions, and even previous plugin systems (e.g., Mail.app bundles) are deprecated or unsupported.

No way to embed or inject dashboard-like UI widgets.

iOS Mail (Apple Mail on iPhone/iPad)
❌ No plugin architecture or extension support

iOS Mail offers no support for extensions or custom UI add-ins.

Only indirect interaction might be via Share Extensions, but that doesn’t allow in-app UI or widget embedding.

Android Mail (Gmail App or OEM clients)
❌ No support for custom add-ins or plugins

Gmail app and most Android mail apps don’t support third-party UI widgets inside the email client.

There are no APIs for creating true in-app dashboard widgets.

Gmail Web Browser
⚠️ Partially possible

No official "add-in" system like Outlook’s.

But:

You can create a Chrome Extension that injects a custom dashboard widget into Gmail’s UI.

The extension can modify the DOM to add panels, sidebars, widgets, etc.

This is not officially supported by Gmail APIs but is widely done.

👉 Example: Streak CRM and Mixmax use this method.

Gmail Mobile App (iOS/Android)
❌ No support for extensions or injected UI

No way to embed widgets.

Gmail mobile app is fully sandboxed, and there’s no extension API or add-in model.

Summary Table
Platform	UI Add-ins / Widgets Possible?	Notes
Outlook Desktop	✅ Yes	Office Add-ins; Task Pane supported
Mac Mail	❌ No	No plugin architecture
iOS Mail	❌ No	No extensions or plugin APIs
Android Mail	❌ No	No official way to extend
Gmail Web Browser	⚠️ Yes, via Chrome Extensions	DOM injection is possible, unofficial
Gmail Mobile App	❌ No	No extensibility

Alternative Ideas (For Limited Clients)
If you must show dashboards on platforms that don’t allow UI extensions, consider:

Deep-linking to a standalone web dashboard, accessed via:

A button in the email (for clients that allow it)

A bookmark on the user’s device

A browser shortcut

Using push notifications or calendar invites with dashboard links embedded.

Let me know if you'd like examples or code for an Outlook add-in or Chrome extension to embed a dashboard.






You said:
For MacMail, would it be possible to write a sidecar-type app that could display to the side or above or below MacMail, and that could manage the window size and placement of MacMail?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, for Mac Mail (Apple Mail), while in-app add-ins are not possible, you can write a sidecar app that:

✅ Displays a dashboard-style widget near the Mac Mail window
and

✅ Controls the position and size of the Mac Mail window
This is entirely feasible using macOS public APIs, particularly via the Accessibility (AX) API and NSWindow-level manipulation.

✅ Feasibility: Sidecar App for Mac Mail
💡 Architecture
Your sidecar app would:

Track the Mac Mail window (identify it using process and window title).

Monitor its position and size using the Accessibility API.

Reposition or resize the Mail window as needed (e.g., to "make room" for your sidecar).

Display your own floating widget in a new NSWindow, positioned beside or above Mail.

🔧 Required Capabilities
1. Accessibility API
   You can get/set another app’s window size and position using AXUIElement.

You'll need to enable Accessibility permissions (NSAppleEventsUsageDescription in Info.plist, and system-wide "Accessibility" access via Security & Privacy).

Use AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue and AXUIElementSetAttributeValue for:

kAXPositionAttribute

kAXSizeAttribute

👉 Reference: Apple AX API Docs

2. Window Tracking
   Poll or observe for when Mail launches or moves using NSWorkspaceDidActivateApplicationNotification, NSRunningApplication, or window enumeration (via AX or private APIs like CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo).

3. Custom Dashboard Window
   Your app would use a borderless, floating NSWindow (e.g., type .panel, .utility, or .status bar) to stay next to Mail.

🚧 Caveats and UX Considerations
Consideration	Details
🔐 Accessibility Access	Users must manually approve in System Settings > Privacy > Accessibility.
🛑 No Docking	No true docking/snap-to like Windows unless you manually maintain placement.
🔄 Resilience	Your app must constantly observe for resize/move/close of the Mail window.
💡 Launch Coordination	You may want your app to auto-launch when Mail launches using LaunchAgents or Login Items.
🌈 Multi-monitor Support	You must account for Mail being moved to another screen, hidden, etc.

🧪 Proof of Concept Tools
Swift or Objective-C with Cocoa

AXSwift (a great Swift wrapper for the Accessibility API): https://github.com/tmandry/AXSwift

pyobjc (if you prefer Python prototyping)

CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo (to get the Mail window without using AX, if needed)

✅ Summary
Feature	Supported?	Notes
Show dashboard widget beside Mail	✅ Yes	Via your own app/window
Control Mac Mail window position/size	✅ Yes	Requires Accessibility permission
Interact with Mail content	❌ No	Not unless you parse via AppleScript or Mail rules
In-app extension inside Mail UI	❌ No	Not possible; Mail does not support plugins or injected UI

Would you like a code skeleton for:

Swift sidecar app that repositions Mail and opens a dashboard panel?

Or an example using AppleScript/Swift combo to detect Mail?
