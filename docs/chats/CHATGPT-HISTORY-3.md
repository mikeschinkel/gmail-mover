# CHAT HISTORY #3 ‚Äî SQLite cross querying tools


You said:
What open-source software is available for querying across multiple Sqlite DBs?

Also, if I am writing an app in Go that will need to shard across multiple DBs, would be reasonably possible to just handle the cross querying within the app, or is it super complicated and thus we'll need to rely on existing software?


ChatGPT said:
There are a few notable open-source tools and libraries that support querying across multiple SQLite databases, and it‚Äôs also entirely feasible to handle this in your Go app if you're sharding deliberately.

üõ†Ô∏è Open Source Tools for Querying Across Multiple SQLite DBs
1. LiteFS
   Purpose: Replication, not querying per se, but relevant for scaling.

Use case: For read-scaling and failover, not sharding/query federation.

2. LiteSQL
   C++ ORM with support for multiple backends. Not useful for runtime SQL.

3. SQLite with ATTACH DATABASE
   Built-in SQLite support.

Attach up to 10 databases in a single connection:

sql
Copy
Edit
ATTACH DATABASE 'shard2.db' AS shard2;
SELECT * FROM shard2.table_name;
Limitations:

Can't use JOIN across tables from different databases if FOREIGN KEY constraints are required.

Limited scalability ‚Äî not ideal for hundreds/thousands of DBs.

4. Datasette
   Read-only HTTP API for SQLite databases.

Can mount multiple DBs and supports some multi-DB querying via plugins.

Not suited for write-heavy apps or sharding logic.

5. dqlite
   Distributed SQLite backed by Raft. More about replication and fault tolerance, not querying across DBs.

üß† Rolling Your Own Multi-DB Query Logic in Go
If you're building an app in Go that will shard across SQLite databases, it is entirely feasible to handle query distribution and aggregation yourself, especially if you‚Äôre in control of:

the schema

the sharding logic

the query patterns (i.e., no need for arbitrary joins across shards)

üîÑ Example: Sharding Strategy
Suppose you're sharding emails by user ID across N SQLite DBs:

go
Copy
Edit
func dbForUser(userID int) *sql.DB {
shard := userID % numShards
return dbs[shard]
}
üß∞ Query Dispatcher Pattern
You can write helper methods like:

go
Copy
Edit
func QueryAcrossShards(query string, args ...any) ([]ResultRow, error) {
var allRows []ResultRow
for _, db := range dbs {
rows, err := db.Query(query, args...)
if err != nil {
return nil, err
}
defer rows.Close()
for rows.Next() {
var r ResultRow
// scan into r
allRows = append(allRows, r)
}
}
return allRows, nil
}
You may need to:

Add virtual columns like shard_id or db_name if the data source matters.

Optionally merge/sort/filter results in-memory.

Use goroutines to parallelize querying across multiple DBs.

üß© What‚Äôs Difficult?
Cross-DB joins ‚Äî require loading data into memory and joining manually.

Transactions across DBs ‚Äî SQLite has no distributed transaction support.

Query planner ‚Äî you'll have to be smart about pushing filters to each DB.

‚úÖ When It‚Äôs Reasonable to Do in App Code
Handling cross-DB queries in app code is reasonable and maintainable if:

Criteria	Status
Shard count is manageable	(e.g. <100)
Query patterns are known	(e.g. by user ID)
Write contention is low	(SQLite is single-writer)
Joins are avoidable or in-memory
You can use Go's concurrency to parallelize

If your usage fits the above, you likely don‚Äôt need external query federation software.

üß© When to Use a Real Federated Query Engine
If you eventually move to a larger scale or more complex querying needs, you may consider:

DuckDB (can query SQLite via extensions)

Apache Drill (heavyweight)

Presto/Trino (can query SQLite via JDBC plugin, but it's heavyweight)

Query middleware like Hasura (GraphQL) ‚Äî though not optimized for SQLite

üßµ Summary
Option	Good For	Bad For
SQLite ATTACH	Small number of static DBs	Dynamic shard management
Custom Go logic	Controlled access/query patterns	Arbitrary cross-DB joins
Datasette	Read-only exploration	Writes, transactional apps
DuckDB + SQLite extension	Analytical workloads, read-only joins	Writes, OLTP

‚úÖ Recommendation for Your Case
Since you're building the app in Go and understand sharding:

Use in-app logic for routing, querying, and joining.

Maybe build a small abstraction layer (a lightweight "query coordinator").

Use goroutines for concurrent querying.

Avoid cross-shard JOINs unless results are small.

If you want a sample skeleton or small proof-of-concept implementation, I can write one.






You said:
This is for using Sqlite as an archival storage for Gmail and later other messages, for an individual. Given that, I think the number of shards should be able to be kept down to 10 or less.  So it sounds like we can just use Sqlite ATTACH, right?


ChatGPT said:
Yes, absolutely ‚Äî in your use case (archival Gmail storage for a single individual), using SQLite's built-in ATTACH mechanism is a practical and efficient solution.

‚úÖ Why ATTACH is Ideal for Your Case
üî¢ Number of DBs (Shards): ‚â§ 10
SQLite supports attaching up to 10 databases per connection by default.

This can be increased at compile time, but for your stated case, you won‚Äôt need to.

üìö Use Case: Archival Email Storage
Emails are immutable after import, so you mostly do reads and inserts, not deletes or updates.

Queries will likely:

Search across all shards by date/sender/subject.

Possibly aggregate summaries (counts, tags, etc.).

Rarely (if ever) require cross-shard joins, since each email is self-contained.

‚ö° Benefits of ATTACH
Query multiple databases with one SQLite connection.

Works seamlessly with SELECT, INSERT, and even subqueries.

Query specific tables like:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM shard1.emails WHERE sender = 'amazon.com'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM shard2.emails WHERE sender = 'amazon.com'
-- etc.
You can do this in Go via:

go
Copy
Edit
db.Exec(`ATTACH DATABASE 'archive2.db' AS shard2`)
üß± Example Setup
Directory layout:
Copy
Edit
archive/
shard1.db
shard2.db
...
Schema (identical across all shards):
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE emails (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
message_id TEXT UNIQUE,
subject TEXT,
sender TEXT,
to TEXT,
cc TEXT,
bcc TEXT,
date_received DATETIME,
raw BLOB,
tags TEXT
);
Sample UNION query across shards:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM shard1.emails WHERE sender = 'foo@example.com'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM shard2.emails WHERE sender = 'foo@example.com';
Or in Go:

go
Copy
Edit
func attachAndQueryShards(db *sql.DB, shardPaths []string, query string) ([]Email, error) {
for i, path := range shardPaths {
_, err := db.Exec(fmt.Sprintf(`ATTACH DATABASE '%s' AS shard%d`, path, i+1))
if err != nil {
return nil, err
}
}
// Run the combined query here...
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats and Tips
Concern	Advice
Cross-shard joins	Avoid if possible ‚Äî instead query and merge in app code.
PRAGMA settings	Must be set per attached DB (if needed).
VACUUM	Cannot be run on an attached database. Run separately.
Foreign keys	Cannot enforce foreign keys across attached DBs. But for immutable email, this is likely fine.
Attach lifetime	ATTACH is per connection. If using a connection pool, re-attach as needed.

üß† Pro Tips
Virtual table name convention: Use aliases like shard1, shard2, etc., to build dynamic queries easily.

Logically route inserts: For example, shard by year, email ID hash, or just by file size threshold.

You might even keep a master DB with metadata (e.g., shard_map table) to track which message ID lives in which shard.

üîö Summary
Yes ‚Äî SQLite ATTACH is the right tool for your use case.

For an individual user's email archive, with ‚â§10 shards and mostly read access, ATTACH provides a robust, zero-dependency, low-complexity solution.

Let me know if you'd like a Go skeleton showing how to:

open shards dynamically

run cross-shard SELECTs with UNION

route INSERTs

or optimize tag-based filtering.






You said:
The one thing where I could see cross-DB joins is with tagging, but I guess we could aggregate queries for tags across shards?


ChatGPT said:
Exactly ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a great insight.

You're right that tagging is one of the few areas where cross-DB joins might feel natural, especially if tags are stored in a normalized relational schema, such as:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Common schema in each shard
CREATE TABLE tags (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE email_tags (
email_id INTEGER,
tag_id INTEGER,
PRIMARY KEY (email_id, tag_id),
FOREIGN KEY (email_id) REFERENCES emails(id),
FOREIGN KEY (tag_id) REFERENCES tags(id)
);
In a single DB, this is perfectly fine. Across multiple shards, you‚Äôll run into two issues:

üö´ Limitations of Cross-DB Joins with SQLite ATTACH
SQLite does not support joins across attached databases when involving foreign keys or writing:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- INVALID in SQLite
SELECT * FROM shard1.emails
JOIN shard2.email_tags ON emails.id = email_tags.email_id;
‚úÖ Workable Alternatives
‚úÖ 1. Repeat tags table in each shard
Make tags a lookup table, duplicated across all shards.

Treat tag IDs as shard-local.

Insert logic ensures consistent tag name-to-ID mapping per shard.

This simplifies all queries within a shard, and lets you aggregate across shards like:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT t.name, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM shard1.email_tags et
JOIN shard1.tags t ON et.tag_id = t.id
GROUP BY t.name

UNION ALL

SELECT t.name, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM shard2.email_tags et
JOIN shard2.tags t ON et.tag_id = t.id
GROUP BY t.name
Then merge/aggregate in Go, e.g.:

go
Copy
Edit
type TagCount struct {
Name string
Count int
}

// Use a map[string]int to merge results
‚úÖ 2. Maintain a central metadata DB for tags
Have a main meta.db (or master.db) that holds:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- meta.db
CREATE TABLE tags (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT UNIQUE
);
Tags are globalized here.

Each shard references tag IDs from this master DB by copying them.

Writes still happen on individual shards, but tag identity is consistent.

This lets you:

Assign tag IDs once

Use tag name lookups before inserting into the appropriate shard

Avoid schema duplication inconsistencies

Drawback: Requires maintaining ID consistency manually across all shards.

‚úÖ 3. Store tags as delimited strings
This breaks normalization (and your DBAs will cry), but it simplifies:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- denormalized table
CREATE TABLE emails (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
subject TEXT,
tags TEXT -- e.g., "work,urgent,budget"
);
Then you can run LIKE-based queries:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM shard1.emails WHERE tags LIKE '%work%';
Or tokenize in Go and do your own filtering and intersection.

This is fast and simple, and works very well for archival and read-mostly datasets.

You can still maintain a master tag table for autocomplete, aliases, etc.

üß† Recommendation for Your Case
Option	Pros	Cons	Recommendation
1. Duplicate tags per shard	Keeps normalization, simple queries	Must sync tag IDs across shards	‚úÖ Best tradeoff
2. Central meta.db	Global tag IDs, avoids duplication	More complex insert/update logic	Good if tags have metadata
3. Denormalized tags TEXT	Simple, efficient for reads	No relational integrity	‚úÖ Great if your queries are tag-based but don‚Äôt need joins

üß© Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)
Use a denormalized string field in each shard for fast filtering:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- "archived,github,urgent"
emails.tags TEXT
AND

Keep a central tags.db with:

tag definitions

aliases

tag groups

descriptions

You use the tags.db for:

UI auto-complete

tag metadata

filtering logic

And the per-shard emails.tags for:

fast read

simple import

eventual consistency

üîö Summary
You do not need cross-shard joins for tags.

Instead:

Normalize within shards, or denormalize into a string.

Use UNION ALL + GROUP BY to aggregate tag data across shards.

Merge results in Go, or build a tag index over time if needed.

Optionally maintain a global tag metadata database.

Let me know if you'd like a Go code snippet or SQL example for any of these options.






You said:
At first I thought I would Repeat tags table in each shard but then realized that tagging could change over time and I don't want to destroy the history of the tags in older shards by forcing them all to be the same.  That means a central metadata DB for tags will also not work, and storing tags as delimited strings is not an option, at least not given how we have denormalized things to save space.

No, I think we'll query each shard individually.

As for the ATTACH command, is this specific to each session and has to be re-attached next time the app is run?


ChatGPT said:
You're exactly right on all fronts:

üß† Tag mutability over time means that duplicating the tags table across shards or having a central tags DB could corrupt or lose historical accuracy.

‚ùå Delimited strings would conflict with your goal of space-efficient normalization, especially if you‚Äôre factoring in deduped tag, address, and possibly name tables.

‚úÖ That leaves querying each shard independently (e.g., with UNION ALL) as the correct and flexible approach ‚Äî keeping tags and other associations historically accurate within each shard.

üîÑ Regarding ATTACH DATABASE
üîê Is ATTACH Persistent?
No, ATTACH DATABASE is not persistent across sessions.

It only lasts for the duration of the current SQLite connection.

When your app restarts or reopens a new connection, the attached DBs must be re-attached again via ATTACH DATABASE.

‚öôÔ∏è Best Practices
1. Auto-attach Shards on Startup
   If you're using 5‚Äì10 shard files like shard1.db through shard10.db, auto-attach them at startup:

go
Copy
Edit
func attachShards(db *sql.DB, shardPaths []string) error {
for i, path := range shardPaths {
alias := fmt.Sprintf("shard%d", i+1)
_, err := db.Exec(fmt.Sprintf(`ATTACH DATABASE '%s' AS %s`, path, alias))
if err != nil {
return fmt.Errorf("failed to attach %s: %w", path, err)
}
}
return nil
}
You could also dynamically discover them with filepath.Glob() or scan a shards/ directory.

2. Connection Lifetime Considerations
   If you use a connection pool (e.g., github.com/jmoiron/sqlx or database/sql), be aware:

Each connection needs to have the ATTACH commands applied.

Therefore, you may want to disable pooling, or use a single long-lived connection, or implement per-connection initialization hooks (trickier in raw database/sql).

Example: Avoid this issue entirely by using a single shared *sql.DB connection and keeping it alive.

3. Optional: Use a Master Wrapper DB
   Instead of attaching multiple separate files every time, you can:

Create a master empty DB file (e.g., archive.db)

On startup, ATTACH the shards into it

Perform all queries against archive.db

This central DB doesn‚Äôt store real data ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a host for the query session

4. Optional Index Table
   To track and dynamically attach shards:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- in meta.db or config file
CREATE TABLE shard_map (
shard_name TEXT,
shard_path TEXT
);
Your app then reads this to know which .db files to attach, instead of hardcoding paths.

‚úÖ Summary
Feature	Behavior
ATTACH DATABASE	Session-only (not persistent)
On app restart	Must re-attach all shards
Querying tags	Per-shard only (due to history retention)
Best strategy	Query all shards with UNION ALL, aggregate in app

You‚Äôve chosen the right approach for your constraints. If you need help building a reusable abstraction in Go for querying and aggregating across shards (e.g., for emails, tags, or addresses), I‚Äôd be happy to draft that.

# ADR-001: SQLite Sharding Strategy for Email Archival

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application is an archival system for Gmail and potentially other messaging services, storing data locally using SQLite. Given long-term growth, the SQLite database will be **sharded** across multiple `.db` files to:

- Manage file size per shard (ensuring performance and stability)
- Enable modular storage with partial backups or sync
- Avoid SQLite limitations on table/index sizes and write contention

Several design tradeoffs were considered for **how to handle querying across shards**, especially for **tag data**, which may change over time.

## Decision

We will:

1. Use **multiple SQLite databases (shards)**, each with an identical schema, where each shard stores a subset of the emails.
2. Use SQLite‚Äôs built-in `ATTACH DATABASE` functionality to query across shards within a single connection.
3. **Re-attach all shards on application startup**, since `ATTACH` is scoped to a single connection and is not persistent across sessions.
4. Avoid connection pooling or ensure each connection is pre-warmed with the correct `ATTACH` commands.
5. Keep **tagging data isolated to each shard**, rather than normalizing globally across shards. This ensures:
    - Tag associations reflect historical context and do not change retroactively.
    - Each shard remains logically self-contained and auditable.
6. Avoid centralized `tags` or `tag_id` tables that span shards, to preserve historical tagging integrity.
7. Perform **cross-shard queries using `UNION ALL`**, and merge results in application code.
8. Optionally maintain a `meta.db` file to record shard file paths and other metadata, for dynamic attachment.

## Rejected Alternatives

- **Duplicating the `tags` table across shards** with identical `tag_id` values:
    - Would require enforcing consistency of tag names and IDs across all shards.
    - Fails to capture the reality that tag definitions and usage may evolve over time.

- **Centralized `tags` database (shared foreign key model):**
    - Introduces complexity in managing foreign key relationships across files.
    - Violates the goal of immutability and self-containment for shards.

- **Storing tags as delimited strings in a `TEXT` column:**
    - Conflicts with the normalized schema design.
    - Inhibits efficient querying and increases storage redundancy.

## Consequences

- Application logic must explicitly handle:
    - Attaching databases on startup
    - Running `UNION ALL` queries across shards
    - Aggregating and filtering results in memory
- Enables independent tagging semantics and historical accuracy per shard.
- Maintains simplicity and SQLite compatibility, with no external query federation layer required.
- Enables long-term scalability to dozens of shards while retaining strong control over performance and storage efficiency.

## Future Considerations

- If the number of shards grows significantly (>100), we may need to:
    - Use dynamic attachment (attach only relevant shards at query time)
    - Create summary/index tables in a central DB for faster lookups
- Consider adding sharding heuristics (by year, sender domain, size thresholds, etc.)
