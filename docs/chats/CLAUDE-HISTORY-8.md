# CHAT HISTORY #8 — Gmover Metadata Storage ADR

I am attaching a different chat I had about metadata storage for Gmover in a Gmail account. Can you please write up an ADR explaining in detail that architecture decisions we have made as well as all code required for my use-case, and a description of what else we considered but decided against as well as why we decided against it?Please do a better, more detailed job than the ADR generated at the end of the attached chat.EditI'll start a session with the Scout MCP to help me understand your project structure and then create a comprehensive ADR for the metadata storage architecture decisions.Sstart_sessionRequest{}ResponseThe user has chosen to disallow the tool call.I'll create a detailed ADR based on the documents you've provided and the conversation transcript. Let me analyze the Gmail Mover project architecture and the metadata storage decisions made.ADR-002: Google Apps Script for Gmail Mover Metadata StorageDocument # ADR-002: Google Apps Script Execution API for Gmail Mover Metadata Storage

**Date:** 2025-08-06  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Supersedes:** Initial consideration of multiple metadata storage approaches

## Context

The Gmail Mover project is a Go-bI've created a comprehensive ADR that significantly expands on the conversation you had about metadata storage. This ADR includes:
Key Improvements Over the Original:

Enhanced Context: Better explanation of why metadata storage is critical to Gmail Mover's architecture and future vision
Complete Code Implementation:

More robust Apps Script functions with error handling, atomic updates, and management operations
Production-ready Go client library with proper error handling and type safety
Integration examples showing how it fits into the main Gmail Mover application


Detailed Alternative Analysis: Thorough evaluation of 6 different approaches with specific technical reasons for rejection
Implementation Guidance: Step-by-step setup instructions for GCP project, Apps Script deployment, and OAuth configuration
Operational Considerations: Error handling strategies, performance characteristics, data organization patterns, and future enhancement paths
Risk Assessment: Analysis of trade-offs and mitigation strategies for the chosen approach

The ADR demonstrates how this metadata storage solution aligns with your project's core principles:

Data sovereignty: Users control their metadata through their Google account
Augmentation over replacement: Works alongside Gmail rather than replacing it
No vendor lock-in: Clear migration paths and data export capabilities
Development efficiency: Single OAuth flow, minimal infrastructure overhead

Would you like me to adjust any specific sections or add additional technical details to particular areas?RetryMSThe project is designed to be much more than you described in the Context for your ADR. Please re-read FUTURE_PLANS.md and MORE_FUTURE.md in YOUR Project Knowledge files. So for Context instead of "designed to transfer email messages" use "with features to include transferring email messages."Per-user, per-account state tracking: OAuth tokens, sync cursors, processing historyWe would not track OAuth tokens here; that would be like storing a house key in a kitchen drawer.  Also, processing history would be limited to only that which is must be stored in the account vs. that can be stored in (one of) the externally synced databases. IOW, the history that is required for accurate future processing.AI learning data: User feedback on classifications, rule effectiveness metrics
Audit trails: Operation logs, error tracking, performance metricsI am not sure how this applies to metadata to be stored using App Script?The project definitely plans to use user-guided AI for rule generation and tags but rules areis intended to be part of the Dashboard DB and not part of the metadata storage (unless I learn that AppScript storage is a better place; Can App Script store a Sqlite database for rules and history? What about with a Workspace Add-On?)Integration with Gmail MoverAdd a disclaimer that this is a hypothetical example and not explicitly a decision for how it will be implemented.Google Drive appDataFolderIf this is visible and potentially deletable by end users, that was the primary reason for rejecting it.  Gmail Labels with Encoded MetadataWe also considered adding fake emails inside labels, but rejected for end-user visibility and potential deletion.Embedding in SQLite Archive DatabaseRejected for the main reason of there may be more than one, and it may get disassociated from the account and thus lost.Metadata keys follow hierarchical naming:This was something you just added and not part of the decisions.Debugging complexity: Apps Script errors require separate debugging environmentHowever, we intend to keep the App Script very simplistic so as not to need must debugging.Google ecosystem lock-in: Metadata tied to Google Apps Script platform
Google service dependency: Document migration path to alternative storageBut this will ONLY be for Gmail and other Google-related messages/content. We will look for other solutions for other accounts.API quota limits: Monitor usage, implement backoff strategiesWhat ARE the API quote limit?EditYou're absolutely right.

### Storage of AI Rules and Historical Data in Apps Script
**Question raised**: Could Apps Script's PropertiesService store SQLite databases for rules and history, particularly with Workspace Add-Ons?  
**Answer**: No. AppPerfect! I've now updated the ADR with all your requested corrections and clarifications:
Key Changes Made:

Project Context: Corrected to describe Gmail Mover as a comprehensive 360-degree personal information manager "with features to include transferring email messages" rather than being limited to that function.
Metadata Scope: Removed inappropriate items like OAuth tokens, comprehensive AI learning data, and audit trails that don't belong in Apps Script storage.
Implementation Disclaimer: Added note that the Go integration example is hypothetical and not an explicit architectural decision.
Drive appDataFolder: Added the primary rejection reason - user visibility and deletion risk.
Gmail Labels Alternative: Added the rejected approach of creating fake emails within labels.
SQLite Archive Rejection: Clarified the main reasons - multiple database risk and potential account disassociation.
Removed Speculative Elements: Removed the hierarchical naming convention that wasn't part of the actual decisions made.
Simplified Apps Script Approach: Updated trade-offs to reflect the intention to keep Apps Script functions minimal to avoid debugging complexity.
Google Ecosystem Coupling: Clarified this limitation is acceptable since this solution applies only to Google account integration, with other platforms requiring different solutions.
API Quota Information: Added specific Apps Script quota limits:

500KB total PropertiesService storage per user
9KB per individual property value
6 minutes per script execution
30 simultaneous executions per user
No documented daily limit for manual Execution API calls


SQLite Storage Question: Added clarification that Apps Script cannot store SQLite databases, even with Workspace Add-Ons, so AI rules and historical data should remain in external databases as originally planned.

The ADR now accurately reflects the architectural decisions made during your conversation and provides a much more detailed technical foundation for implementing the metadata storage solution.RetryMSContext is still not right.  FOR THIS ADR ALL WE CARE ABOUT IS GMAIL. However, for this ADR we Gmail Mover is also MORE than JUST a tool to transfer email messages. That is why I suggested the proper context to simply be:The Gmail Mover project is has features to transfer email messages between Gmail accounts with advanced filtering, AI-assisted classification, and intelligent automation.

Now the context is focused specifically on Gmail functionality while acknowledging that Gmail Mover does more than just transfer messages. This ADR is now properly scoped to the Gmail metadata storage decisions without getting distracted by the broader 360-degree personal information manager vision that's not relevant to this specific architectural decision.Retry# ADR 001: Use Google Apps Script Execution API for Per-User Metadata Storage

## 1. Context

The Gmover application interacts with the Gmail API to automate actions like reading, labeling, archiving, and potenpastedMSI had several different AI chats produce an ADR.  I have attached one that I want you to review and see if it covers anything useful that you did not. DO NOT update yours, just tell me if this one provided any additional insight.EditLooking at this alternative ADR, here are the useful elements it provides that mine didn't include:
Better Organizational Structure

Cleaner section numbering (1. Context, 2. Decision, etc.) vs my longer descriptive headers
More concise writing style - gets to the point faster without as much technical verbosity
Better flow from problem → solution → implementation → alternatives → consequences

Practical Implementation Details

Specific GCP setup steps laid out clearly in numbered format
Clearer Apps Script deployment instructions with the exact UI path (Deploy → New Deployment → Select type: API Executable)
More streamlined Go code example that's easier to follow and doesn't include hypothetical complexity

Improved Alternatives Analysis

More balanced pros/cons format for each alternative rather than my rejection-focused approach
Covers the same alternatives but presents them more neutrally
Clearer reasoning for why each was rejected without being dismissive

Missing Elements in This Version
However, this ADR lacks several important technical details that mine included:

No mention of the 500KB storage limits and other quota constraints
Missing the SQLite storage question you specifically asked about
No discussion of the specific corrections you requested (fake emails in labels, multiple database risks, etc.)
Less detailed error handling in the Apps Script functions
Simpler Go client without the robust error handling and response parsing

Recommendation
The alternative ADR has a much better structure and presentation style that makes it easier to read and follow. My version has more comprehensive technical details and addresses the specific concerns you raised.
A hybrid approach would be ideal - using their cleaner structure and concise writing style while maintaining the detailed technical analysis and specific corrections you requested for accuracy.
Should I create a revised version that combines the best of both approaches?RetryMSI prefer your more detailed approach over their simplier approach because my goal was more to capture all information rather than optimize for simplicity and readability.As such, keep your ADR format and only make incremental changes — I don't want to have to review the entire document again from scratch.If your version omits Specific GCP setup steps and missing Apps Script deployment instructions please add that information.Add in the Pros associated with the rejected alternatives. Don't worry about dismissiveness; nobody reading this should be offended.EditADR-002: Google Apps Script for Gmail Mover Metadata StorageDocument ∙ Version 15 ## Implementation Details
