# My Building in Public Tweets

Day 3 — Why am I building GMover?

Mac Mail stopped displaying my emails. Was it the 30k emails in my INBOX between my Gmail and Google Workspace accounts? I decided to write an archive tool to move emails in inboxes to a new Gmail account I opened for "archiving."  

But I realized Gmover could be so much more. Follow me to hear what nore, and to track my progress.

Day 2 for building my Gmail-related startup in public. Still not really sure what will resonate with people, so I'll just link my GitHub repo URL:

https://github.com/mikeschinkel/gmover

This started as a "scratch my own itch" kind of project so the description and README have not exactly kept up with my evolving vision. But I'll certainly get to that at some point soon.

Today is Day 1 for me to build a startup in public.

I wrote an app to solve a Gmail-related problem I had but realized I could also not only tackle my email overload but also possibly help others solve the same.

In you are interested, please follow along.

Do you use http://gmail.com or a custom Google Workspace email domain?

Are you on Team Inbox Zero or do you just experience email overload?

If yes, I would love to learn your biggest pain points and your ideas for what could address your pain via a short interview.

Include personal accounts at @gmail.com plus any Google Workspace accounts @ a business domain. Omit any you just use for email forwarding but not its inbox.
