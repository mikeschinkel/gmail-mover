# ADR-000: Adopting Architecture Decision Records

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-08

## Context

The Gmail Mover project has grown in complexity and scope, requiring clear documentation of architectural decisions to maintain consistency and provide context for future development. As the project evolves from a simple email transfer tool to a comprehensive personal information management platform, architectural decisions need to be captured and communicated effectively.

## Decision

We will adopt **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** to document significant architectural decisions in this project.

## Format

Each ADR will follow this lightweight structure:

- **ADR-XXX: Title**
- **Status:** (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
- **Date:** Decision date
- **Context:** The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision:** What we decided to do
- **Implementation:** How this is implemented (when relevant)
- **Rationale:** Why we made this choice
- **Consequences:** Trade-offs and implications

## Scope

ADRs will document decisions that:
- Affect the overall architecture of the system
- Have long-term implications for the project
- Are difficult or expensive to change later
- Provide significant context for understanding the codebase
- Shape how features are implemented

## Storage and Numbering

- ADRs are stored in the `./adrs/` directory
- Numbered sequentially starting from ADR-000
- File naming convention: `adr-XXX-brief-title.md`
- Cross-references between ADRs use the ADR-XXX format

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Architectural decisions are documented and searchable
- New contributors can understand the reasoning behind design choices
- Reduces repeated discussions about already-decided issues
- Provides historical context for the evolution of the project
- Enables better decision-making by understanding past trade-offs

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires discipline to maintain and update ADRs
- Adds overhead to the decision-making process
- ADRs can become outdated if not maintained
